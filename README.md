This repository is for the development of a landscape series, using the [shadertoy extension](https://github.com/stevensona/shader-toy/blob/master/package.json). Grateful credit is given to [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/).

Ideally, the landscapes will implement Perlin noise and rim lighting around silhouetted objects. Concepts from the book [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) are also used.

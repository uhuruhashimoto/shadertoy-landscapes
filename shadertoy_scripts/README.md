# Shadertoy Scripts

These files are meant to be copied directly into a shadertoy browser
window for testing, because the shadertoy extension/my GPU
can't handle the load reliably.

Therefore, they have a lot of repeat code with small changes to save progress.

For code to grade, please look at `final.glsl`.

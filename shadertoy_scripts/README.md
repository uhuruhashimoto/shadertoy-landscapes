# Shadertoy Scripts
This directory contains a final shadertoy version of the realistic animated mountain landscape (`final.glsl`).

All files within this directory are meant to be copied directly into a shadertoy browser window for testing, because the shadertoy extension/my GPU can't handle the load reliably.

Therefore, they have a lot of repeat code with small changes to save progress. These versions are included in the `previous_versions` subdirectory.

For code to grade, please look at `final.glsl`.
